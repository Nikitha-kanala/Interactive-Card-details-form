# Interactive-Card-details-form
Create an interactive card form where users see real-time updates. On submit, show errors if fields are empty or incorrectly formatted (card number, expiry, CVC). The layout must be responsive for all devices, and interactive elements should have hover, focus, and active states for better UX.
